# Decorator-Pattern

A Decorator pattern can be used to attach additional responsibilities to an object either statically or dynamically. A Decorator provides an enhanced interface to the original object. In the implementation of this pattern, we prefer composition over an inheritance â€“ so that we can reduce the overhead of subclassing again and again for each decorating element. The recursion involved with this design can be used to decorate our object as many times as we require.
